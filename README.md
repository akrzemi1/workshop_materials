# Workshop materials
Materials for Code Europe 2017 workshop will be provided shortly on this page

## Scope of the workshop
We will be designing a small, fat and safe type for representing short codes, (like "PL", representing country Poland). This includes:
* setting the performance and safety goals for our type,
* designing tests,
* providing the implementation.

## Prerequisites
1. You will need to bring your own laptop with you
2. You will need a C++11 compiler, such as:
   * GCC 4.7 or higher (ideally, GCC 5 or higher)
   * Clang 3.3 or higher
   * Visual Studio 2013 or higher
   * For GCC on Wondows, I recommend https://nuwen.net/mingw.html
3. Preferably, bring a C++14 compiler, although this is not strictly necessary.
4. You will need to be able to comipe and execute your C++ programs.
5. No particular IDE is required; it is sufficient to use notepad or vim and run a compiler form command-line.
